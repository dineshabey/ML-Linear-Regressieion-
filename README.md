# ML-Regresseion analysis example

In this machine learning project, you are using regression analysis to understand the relationship between years of experience and salary increase. Regression analysis helps you predict the salary increase based on the number of years of experience a person has.

By using Google Colab, you can take advantage of its free access to computing resources and its integration with Google Drive for data storage. Google Colab also provides a convenient environment for running Python code, including machine learning algorithms using libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Your project involves loading the salary data, performing data preprocessing (such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables), splitting the data into training and testing sets, and then training a regression model on the training data.

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the testing data and metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. Finally, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data to estimate the salary increase based on years of experience.

Overall, this project allows you to gain insights into the relationship between experience and salary increase, and to build a predictive model that can be used to make informed decisions in HR or business contexts.
